## Clicking script with Python

Uses `pynput` and `pyautogui` library for detecting keyboard input and sending clicks.

Uses `R` key to toggle clicking, `ESC` as a general failsafe to exit the program.

CPS is set from a variable inside the script


Can anyone give me tips on how to not use globals so much? Or is it okay enough for a simple script?
