## Clicking script with Python

Uses `pynput` for detecting keyboard input and `pyautogui` for sending clicks.

Uses `tkinter` to make a simple gui that displays whether or not the program is active, and has a slider for setting speed.

Uses `R` key to toggle clicking, `ESC` as a general failsafe to exit the program.

CPS can be set from 0.1 to 50 based on a slider in the GUI.
